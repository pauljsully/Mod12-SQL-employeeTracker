# Mod12-SQL-employeeTracker

We want to build an application that is able to write and save notes, so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.


## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN a note-taking application
    WHEN I open the Note Taker
    THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
    WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
    THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
    WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
    THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
    WHEN I click on the Save button
    THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
    WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
    THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
    WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
    THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears
